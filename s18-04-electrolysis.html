    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch14_s04_p01">Up to this point, we have considered redox reactions for processes that are spontaneous. When set up as a voltaic cell or battery, such reactions can be used as a source of electricity. However, it is possible to go in the other direction. By forcing electricity into a cell, we can make a redox reaction occur that normally would not be spontaneous. Under these circumstances, the cell is called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">electrolytic cell</a><span class="glossdef">A cell into which electricity is forced to make a nonspontaneous reaction occur.</span></span>, and the process that occurs in the cell is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">electrolysis</a><span class="glossdef">The process of making a nonspontaneous redox reaction occur by forcing electricity into a cell.</span></span> (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch14_s04_f01">Figure 14.5 "Electrolysis"</a>).</p>

        <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 14.5</span> Electrolysis</p>
        <img src="section_18/9679947ab90398b8826bea46aa85c1c6.jpg">
        <p class="para">In an electrolytic cell, electricity is forced through the cell to induce a nonspontaneous redox reaction. Here, the redox reaction 2H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O → 2H<sub class="subscript">2</sub> + O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is being caused by the introduction of electricity, which is supplied by the battery.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch14_s04_p02">Electrolysis has many applications. For example, if NaCl is melted at about 800°C in an electrolytic cell and an electric current is passed through it, elemental sodium will appear at the cathode and elemental chlorine will appear at the anode as the following two reactions occur:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> + e<sup class="superscript">−</sup> → Na</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">2Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup> → Cl<sub class="subscript">2</sub> + 2e<sup class="superscript">−</sup></span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch14_s04_p03">Normally we expect elemental sodium and chlorine to react spontaneously to make NaCl. However, by using an input of electricity, we can force the opposite reaction to occur and generate the elements. Lithium, potassium, and magnesium can also be isolated from compounds by electrolysis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch14_s04_p04">Another element that is isolated by electrolysis is aluminum. Aluminum formerly was a difficult metal to isolate in its elemental form; in fact, the top of the Washington Monument has a 2.8 kg cap of aluminum metal, which at the time—1884—was the largest piece of elemental aluminum ever isolated. However, in 1886 the American Charles Hall and the Frenchman Paul Héroult almost simultaneously worked out an electrolytic process for isolating aluminum from bauxite, an ore of aluminum whose chemical formula is AlO<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">x</em></sub>(OH)<sub class="subscript">3 − 2</sub><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">x</em></sub>. The basic reactions are as follows:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">Al<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> + 3e<sup class="superscript">−</sup> → Al</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">2O<sup class="superscript">2−</sup> → O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> + 4e<sup class="superscript">−</sup></span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch14_s04_p05">With the development of the Hall-Héroult process, the price of aluminum dropped by a factor of over 200, and aluminum metal became common. So much elemental aluminum is produced in the United States each year that it has been estimated that the electrolysis of aluminum uses 5% of all the electricity in the country. (Recycling aluminum requires about 1/70th the energy of refining aluminum from ore, which illustrates the tremendous energy savings that recycling provides.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch14_s04_p06">Another application of electrolysis is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">electroplating</a><span class="glossdef">The deposition of a thin layer of metal on an object for protective or decorative purposes.</span></span>, which is the deposition of a thin layer of metal on an object for protective or decorative purposes (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch14_s04_f02">Figure 14.6</a>). Essentially, a metal object is connected to the cathode of an electrolytic cell and immersed in a solution of a particular metal cation. When the electrolytic cell is operated, a thin coating of the metal cation is reduced to the elemental metal on the surface of the object; the thickness of the coating can be as little as a few micrometers (10<sup class="superscript">−6</sup> m). Jewelry, eating utensils, electrical contacts, and car parts like bumpers are common items that are electroplated. Gold, silver, nickel, copper, and chromium are common metals used in electroplating.</p>
