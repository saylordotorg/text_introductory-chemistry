A book is matter, a computer is matter, food is matter, and dirt in the ground is matter. Sometimes matter may be difficult to identify. For example, air is matter, but because it is so thin compared to other matter (e.g., a book, a computer, food, and dirt), we sometimes forget that air has mass and takes up space. Things that are not matter include thoughts, ideas, emotions, and hopes.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch01_s01_p05">To understand matter and how it changes, we need to be able to describe matter. There are two basic ways to describe matter: physical properties and chemical properties. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Physical properties</a><span class="glossdef">A characteristic that describes matter as it exists.</span></span> are characteristics that describe matter as it exists. Some of many physical characteristics of matter are shape, color, size, and temperature. An important physical property is the <strong class="emphasis bold">phase</strong> (or <strong class="emphasis bold">state</strong>) of matter. The three fundamental phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas (see <a class="xref" href="#ball-ch01_s01_f01">Figure 1.1 "The Phases of Matter"</a>).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch01_s01_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Chemical properties</a><span class="glossdef">A characteristic that describes how matter changes form in the presence of other matter.</span></span> are characteristics of matter that describe how matter changes form in the presence of other matter. Does a sample of matter burn? Burning is a chemical property. Does it behave violently when put in water? This reaction is a chemical property as well (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch01_s01_f02">Figure 1.2 "Chemical Properties"</a>). In the following chapters, we will see how descriptions of physical and chemical properties are important aspects of chemistry.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch01_s01_p07">If matter always stayed the same, chemistry would be rather boring. Fortunately, a major part of chemistry involves change. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">physical change</a><span class="glossdef">A change that occurs when a sample of matter changes one or more of its physical properties.</span></span> occurs when a sample of matter changes one or more of its physical properties. For example, a solid may melt (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch01_s01_f03">Figure 1.3 "Physical Changes"</a>), or alcohol in a thermometer may change volume as the temperature changes. A physical change does not affect the chemical composition of matter.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch01_s01_p08">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chemical change</a><span class="glossdef">The process of demonstrating a chemical property.</span></span> is the process of demonstrating a chemical property, such as the burning match in <a class="xref" href="#ball-ch01_s01_f02">Figure 1.2 "Chemical Properties"</a>. As the matter in the match burns, its chemical composition changes, and new forms of matter with new physical properties are created. Note that chemical changes are frequently accompanied by physical changes, as the new matter will likely have different physical properties from the original matter.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch01_s01_p11">A sample of matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">substance</a><span class="glossdef">Matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout.</span></span>. Sometimes the phrase <em class="emphasis">pure substance</em> is used, but the word <em class="emphasis">pure</em> isn’t needed. The definition of the term <em class="emphasis">substance</em> is an example of how chemistry has a specific definition for a word that is used in everyday language with a different, vaguer definition. Here, we will use the term <em class="emphasis">substance</em> with its strict chemical definition.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch01_s01_p12">Chemistry recognizes two different types of substances: elements and compounds. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">element</a><span class="glossdef">A substance that cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances by ordinary chemical means.</span></span> is the simplest type of chemical substance; it cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances by ordinary chemical means. There are about 115 elements known to science, of which 80 are stable. (The other elements are radioactive, a condition we will consider in <a class="xref" href="ball-ch15#ball-ch15">Chapter 15 "Nuclear Chemistry"</a>.) Each element has its own unique set of physical and chemical properties. Examples of elements include iron, carbon, and gold.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch01_s01_p13">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compound</a><span class="glossdef">A combination of more than one element.</span></span> is a combination of more than one element. The physical and chemical properties of a compound are different from the physical and chemical properties of its constituent elements; that is, it behaves as a completely different substance. There are over 50 million compounds known, and more are being discovered daily. Examples of compounds include water, penicillin, and sodium chloride (the chemical name for common table salt).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch01_s01_p14">Elements and compounds are not the only ways in which matter can be present. We frequently encounter objects that are physical combinations of more than one element or compound. Physical combinations of more than one substance are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mixtures</a><span class="glossdef">A physical combination of more than one substance.</span></span>. There are two types of mixtures. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">heterogeneous mixture</a><span class="glossdef">A mixture composed of two or more substances.</span></span> is a mixture composed of two or more substances. It is easy to tell, sometimes by the naked eye, that more than one substance is present. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">homogeneous mixture</a><span class="glossdef">A combination of two or more substances that is so intimately mixed that the mixture behaves as a single substance.</span></span> is a combination of two or more substances that is so intimately mixed that the mixture behaves as a single substance. Another word for a homogeneous mixture is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">solution</a><span class="glossdef">Another name for a homogeneous mixture.</span></span>. Thus, a combination of salt and steel wool is a heterogeneous mixture because it is easy to see which particles of the matter are salt crystals and which are steel wool. On the other hand, if you take salt crystals and dissolve them in water, it is very difficult to tell that you have more than one substance present just by looking—even if you use a powerful microscope. The salt dissolved in water is a homogeneous mixture, or a solution (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch01_s01_f04">Figure 1.4 "Types of Mixtures"</a>).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch01_s01_p17">There are other descriptors that we can use to describe matter, especially elements.

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonmetal</a><span class="glossdef">An element that exists in various colors and phases, is brittle, and does not conduct electricity or heat well.</span></span> is an element that is brittle when solid, does not conduct electricity or heat very well, and cannot be made into thin sheets or wires (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch01_s01_f05">Figure 1.5 "Semimetals"</a>). Nonmetals also exist in a variety of phases and colors at room temperature.

            <li>When you brush your teeth in the morning, you usually use toothpaste, a form of soap, to clean your teeth.

            <li>Perhaps you take vitamins, supplements, or medicines every morning. Vitamins and other supplements contain chemicals your body needs in small amounts to function properly. Medicines are chemicals that help combat diseases and promote health.</li>
            <li>Perhaps you make some fried eggs for breakfast. Frying eggs involves heating them enough so that a chemical reaction occurs to cook the eggs.</li>
            <li>After you eat, the food in your stomach is chemically reacted so that the body (mostly the intestines) can absorb food, water, and other nutrients.</li>
