        <p class="para" id="ball-ch10_p01">There is an urban legend that glass is an extremely thick liquid rather than a solid, even at room temperature. Proponents claim that old windows are thicker at the bottom than at the top, suggesting that the glass flowed down over time. Unfortunately, the proponents of this idea have no credible evidence that this is true, as old windows were likely not subject to the stricter manufacturing standards that exist today. Also, when mounting a piece of glass that has an obviously variable thickness, it makes structural sense to put the thicker part at the bottom, where it will support the object better.</p>
        <p class="para" id="ball-ch10_p02">Liquids flow when a small force is placed on them, even if only very slowly. Solids, however, may deform under a small force, but they return to their original shape when the force is relaxed. This is how glass behaves: it goes back to its original shape (unless it breaks under the applied force). Observers also point out that telescopes with glass lenses to focus light still do so even decades after manufacture—a circumstance that would not be so if the lens were liquid and flowed.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s01_p01">Why does a substance have the phase it does? The preferred phase of a substance at a given set of conditions is a balance between the energy of the particles and intermolecular forces (or intermolecular interactions) between the particles. If the forces between particles are strong enough, the substance is a liquid or, if stronger, a solid. If the forces between particles are weak and sufficient energy is present, the particles separate from each other, so the gas phase is the preferred phase. The energy of the particles is mostly determined by temperature, so temperature is the main variable that determines what phase is stable at any given point.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s01_p02">What forces define intermolecular interactions? There are several. A force present in all substances with electrons is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dispersion force</a><span class="glossdef">An intermolecular force caused by the instantaneous position of an electron in a molecule.</span></span> (sometimes called the <em class="emphasis">London dispersion force</em>, after the physicist Fritz London, who first described this force in the early 1900s). This interaction is caused by the instantaneous position of an electron in a molecule, which temporarily makes that point of the molecule negatively charged and the rest of the molecule positively charged. In an instant, the electron is now somewhere else, but the fleeting imbalance of electric charge in the molecule allows molecules to interact with each other. As you might expect, the greater the number of electrons in a species, the stronger the dispersion force; this partially explains why smaller molecules are gases and larger molecules are liquids and solids at the same temperature. (Mass is a factor as well.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s01_p03">Molecules with a permanent dipole moment experience <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dipole-dipole interactions</a><span class="glossdef">An intermolecular force caused by molecules with a permanent dipole.</span></span>, which are generally stronger than dispersion forces if all other things are equal. The oppositely charged ends of a polar molecule, which have partial charges on them, attract each other (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s01_f01">Figure 10.1 "Dipole-Dipole Interactions"</a>). Thus a polar molecule such CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Cl<sub class="subscript">2</sub> has a significantly higher boiling point (313 K, or 40°C) than a nonpolar molecule like CF<sub class="subscript">4</sub> (145 K, or −128°C), even though it has a lower molar mass (85 g/mol vs. 88 g/mol).</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s01_p04">An unusually strong form of dipole-dipole interaction is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hydrogen bonding</a><span class="glossdef">The very strong interaction between molecules due to H atoms being bonded to N, O, or F atoms.</span></span>. Hydrogen bonding is found in molecules with an H atom bonded to an N atom, an O atom, or an F atom. Such covalent bonds are very polar, and the dipole-dipole interaction between these bonds in two or more molecules is strong enough to create a new category of intermolecular force. Hydrogen bonding is the reason water has unusual properties. For such a small molecule (its molar mass is only 18 g/mol), H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O has relatively high melting and boiling points. Its boiling point is 373 K (100°C), while the boiling point of a similar molecule, H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>S, is 233 K (−60°C). This is because H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O molecules experience hydrogen bonding, while H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>S molecules do not. This strong attraction between H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O molecules requires additional energy to separate the molecules in the condensed phase, so its boiling point is higher than would be expected. Hydrogen bonding is also responsible for water’s ability as a solvent, its high heat capacity, and its ability to expand when freezing; the molecules line up in such a way that there is extra space between the molecules, increasing its volume in the solid state (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s01_f02">Figure 10.2 "Hydrogen Bonding"</a>).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s01_p07">The preferred phase a substance adopts can change with temperature. At low temperatures, most substances are solids (only helium is predicted to be a liquid at absolute zero). As the temperature increases, those substances with very weak intermolecular forces become gases directly (in a process called <em class="emphasis">sublimation</em>, which will be discussed in <a class="xref" href="ball-ch10_s02#ball-ch10_s02">Section 10.2 "Phase Transitions: Melting, Boiling, and Subliming"</a>). Substances with weak interactions can become liquids as the temperature increases. As the temperature increases even more, the individual particles will have so much energy that the intermolecular forces are overcome, so the particles separate from each other, and the substance becomes a gas (assuming that their chemical bonds are not so weak that the compound decomposes from the high temperature). Although is it difficult to predict the temperature ranges for which solid, liquid, or gas is the preferred phase for any random substance, all substances progress from solid to liquid to gas in that order as temperature increases.</p>

The opposite process, a liquid becoming a solid, is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">solidification</a><span class="glossdef">The process of a liquid becoming a solid.</span></span>. For any pure substance, the temperature at which melting occurs—known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">melting point</a><span class="glossdef">The characteristic temperature at which a solid becomes a liquid.</span></span>—is a characteristic of that substance. It requires energy for a solid to melt into a liquid. Every pure substance has a certain amount of energy it needs to change from a solid to a liquid. This amount is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">enthalpy of fusion (or heat of fusion)</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of energy needed to change from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid.</span></span> of the substance, represented as Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">fus</sub>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s02_p08">During melting, energy goes exclusively to changing the phase of a substance; it does not go into changing the temperature of a substance. Hence melting is an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">isothermal</a><span class="glossdef">A process that does not change the temperature.</span></span> process because a substance stays at the same temperature. Only when all of a substance is melted does any additional energy go to changing its temperature.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s02_p09">What happens when a solid becomes a liquid? In a solid, individual particles are stuck in place because the intermolecular forces cannot be overcome by the energy of the particles. When more energy is supplied (e.g., by raising the temperature), there comes a point at which the particles have enough energy to move around but not enough energy to separate. This is the liquid phase: particles are still in contact but are able to move around each other. This explains why liquids can assume the shape of their containers: the particles move around and, under the influence of gravity, fill the lowest volume possible (unless the liquid is in a zero-gravity environment—see <a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s02_f01">Figure 10.3 "Liquids and Gravity"</a>).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s02_p10">The phase change between a liquid and a gas has some similarities to the phase change between a solid and a liquid. At a certain temperature, the particles in a liquid have enough energy to become a gas. The process of a liquid becoming a gas is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">boiling (or vaporization)</a><span class="glossdef">The process of a liquid becoming a gas.</span></span>, while the process of a gas becoming a liquid is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">condensation</a><span class="glossdef">The process of a gas becoming a liquid.</span></span>. However, unlike the solid/liquid conversion process, the liquid/gas conversion process is noticeably affected by the surrounding pressure on the liquid because gases are strongly affected by pressure. This means that the temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">boiling point</a><span class="glossdef">The characteristic temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas.</span></span>, can change with surrounding pressure. Therefore, we define the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">normal boiling point</a><span class="glossdef">The characteristic temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas when the surrounding pressure is exactly 1 atm.</span></span> as the temperature at which a liquid changes to a gas when the surrounding pressure is exactly 1 atm, or 760 torr. Unless otherwise specified, it is assumed that a boiling point is for 1 atm of pressure.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s02_p11">Like the solid/liquid phase change, the liquid/gas phase change involves energy. The amount of energy required to convert a liquid to a gas is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">enthalpy of vaporization</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of energy needed to change from a liquid to a gas or from a gas to a liquid.</span></span> (or heat of vaporization), represented as Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">vap</sub>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s02_p18">What happens when a liquid becomes a gas? We have already established that a liquid is composed of particles in contact with each other. When a liquid becomes a gas, the particles separate from each other, with each particle going its own way in space. This is how gases tend to fill their containers. Indeed, in the gas phase most of the volume is empty space; only about 1/1,000th of the volume is actually taken up by matter (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s02_f02">Figure 10.4 "Liquids and Gases"</a>). It is this property of gases that explains why they can be compressed, a fact that is considered in <a class="xref" href="ball-ch06#ball-ch06">Chapter 6 "Gases"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s02_p19">Under some circumstances, the solid phase can transition directly to the gas phase without going through a liquid phase, and a gas can directly become a solid. The solid-to-gas change is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sublimation</a><span class="glossdef">The process of a solid becoming a gas.</span></span>, while the reverse process is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">deposition</a><span class="glossdef">The process of a gas becoming a solid.</span></span>. Sublimation is isothermal, like the other phase changes. There is a measurable energy change during sublimation; this energy change is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">enthalpy of sublimation</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of energy needed to change from a solid to a gas or from a gas to a solid.</span></span>, represented as Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">sub</sub>.

    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">sub</sub> = Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">fus</sub> + Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">vap</sub></span></span>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s02_p21">There are several common examples of sublimation. A well-known product—dry ice—is actually solid CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. Dry ice is dry because it sublimes, with the solid bypassing the liquid phase and going straight to the gas phase. The sublimation occurs at temperature of −77°C, so it must be handled with caution. If you have ever noticed that ice cubes in a freezer tend to get smaller over time, it is because the solid water is very slowly subliming. “Freezer burn” isn’t actually a burn; it occurs when certain foods, such as meats, slowly lose solid water content because of sublimation. The food is still good but looks unappetizing. Reducing the temperature of a freezer will slow the sublimation of solid water.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s02_p22">Chemical equations can be used to represent a phase change. In such cases, it is crucial to use phase labels on the substances. For example, the chemical equation for the melting of ice to make liquid water is as follows:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s03_p05">The vapor pressure for a substance is dependent on the temperature of the substance; as the temperature increases, so does the vapor pressure. <a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s03_f03">Figure 10.7 "Plots of Vapor Pressure versus Temperature for Several Liquids"</a> is a plot of vapor pressure versus temperature for several liquids. Having defined vapor pressure, we can also redefine the <em class="emphasis">boiling point</em> of a liquid: the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. The normal vapor pressure, then, is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is 760 torr, or exactly 1 atm. Thus boiling points vary with surrounding pressure, a fact that can have large implications on cooking foods at lower- or higher-than-normal elevations. Atmospheric pressure varies significantly with altitude.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s03_p11">The vapor pressure curve for water is not exactly zero at the melting point—0°C. Even ice has a vapor pressure; that is why it sublimes over time. However, the vapor pressures of solids are typically much lower than that of liquids. At −1°C, the vapor pressure of ice is 4.2 torr. At a freezer temperature of 0°F (−17°C), the vapor pressure of ice is only 1.0 torr; so-called deep freezers can get down to −23°C, where the vapor pressure of ice is only 0.6 torr.</p>

The blue particle in the bulk of the liquid experiences intermolecular forces from all around, as illustrated by the arrows. However, the yellow particle on the surface does not experience any forces above it because there are no particles above it. This leads to an imbalance of forces that we call surface tension.</p>

        <p class="para">Surface tension comes from the fact that particles at the surface of a liquid do not experience interactions from all directions, leading to an imbalance of forces on the surface.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s03_p13">Surface tension is responsible for several well-known behaviors of liquids, including water. Liquids with high surface tension tend to bead up when present in small amounts (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s03_f06">Figure 10.10 "Effects of Surface Tension"</a>). Surface tension causes liquids to form spheres in free fall or zero gravity (see <a class="xref" href="ball-ch10_s02#ball-ch10_s02_f01">Figure 10.3 "Liquids and Gravity"</a>: the “floating” water isn’t in the shape of a sphere by accident; it is the result of surface tension). Surface tension is also responsible for the fact that small insects can “walk” on water. Because of surface tension, it takes energy to break the surface of a liquid, and if an object (such as an insect) is light enough, there is not enough force due to gravity for the object to break through the surface, so the object stays on top of the water (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s03_f07">Figure 10.11 "Walking on Water"</a>). Carefully done, this phenomenon can also be illustrated with a thin razor blade or a paper clip.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s03_p14">The fact that small droplets of water bead up on surfaces does not mean that water—or any other liquid—does not interact with other substances. Sometimes the attraction can be very strong. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Adhesion</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency of a substance to interact with other substances because of intermolecular forces.</span></span> is the tendency of a substance to interact with other substances because of intermolecular forces, while <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cohesion</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency of a substance to interact with itself.</span></span> is the tendency of a substance to interact with itself. If cohesive forces within a liquid are stronger than adhesive forces between a liquid and another substance, then the liquid tends to keep to itself; it will bead up. However, if adhesive forces between a liquid and another substance are stronger than cohesive forces, then the liquid will spread out over the other substance, trying to maximize the interface between the other substance and the liquid. We say that the liquid <em class="emphasis">wets</em> the other substance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s03_p15">Adhesion and cohesion are important for other phenomena as well. In particular, if adhesive forces are strong, then when a liquid is introduced to a small-diameter tube of another substance, the liquid moves up or down in the tube, as if ignoring gravity. Because tiny tubes are called capillaries, this phenomenon is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capillary action</a><span class="glossdef">The behavior of a liquid in narrow surfaces due to differences in adhesion and cohesion.</span></span>. For example, one type of capillary action—<em class="emphasis">capillary rise</em>—is seen when water or water-based liquids rise up in thin glass tubes (like the capillaries sometimes used in blood tests), forming an upwardly curved surface called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">meniscus</a><span class="glossdef">The curved surface a liquid makes as it approaches a solid barrier.</span></span>. Capillary action is also responsible for the “wicking” effect that towels and sponges use to dry wet objects; the matting of fibers forms tiny capillaries that have good adhesion with water. Cotton is a good material for this; polyester and other synthetic fabrics do not display similar capillary action, which is why you seldom find rayon bath towels. A similar effect is observed with liquid fuels or melted wax and their wicks. Capillary action is thought to be at least partially responsible for transporting water from the roots to the tops of trees, even tall ones.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s03_p16">On the other hand, some liquids have stronger cohesive forces than adhesive forces. In this case, in the presence of a capillary, the liquid is forced down from its surface; this is an example of a type of capillary action called <em class="emphasis">capillary depression</em>. In this case, the meniscus curves downward. Mercury has very strong cohesive forces; when a capillary is placed in a pool of mercury, the surface of the mercury liquid is depressed (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s03_f08">Figure 10.12 "Capillary Action"</a>).</p>

        <h3 class="title">Chemistry Is Everywhere: Waxing a Car</h3>
        <p class="para" id="ball-ch10_s03_p17">Responsible car owners are encouraged to wax their cars regularly. In addition to making the car look nicer, it also helps protect the surface, especially if the surface is metal. Why?</p>
        <p class="para" id="ball-ch10_s03_p18">The answer has to do with cohesion and adhesion (and, to a lesser extent, rust). Water is an important factor in the rusting of iron, sometimes used extensively in outer car bodies. Keeping water away from the metal is one way to minimize rusting. A coat of paint helps with this. However, dirty or scratched paint can attract water, and adhesive forces will allow the water to wet the surface, maximizing its contact with the metal and promoting rust.</p>
        <p class="para" id="ball-ch10_s03_p19">Wax is composed of long hydrocarbon molecules that do not interact well with water. (Hydrocarbons are compounds with C and H atoms; for more information on hydrocarbons, see <a class="xref" href="ball-ch16#ball-ch16">Chapter 16 "Organic Chemistry"</a>.) That is, a thin layer of wax will not be wetted by water. A freshly waxed car has low adhesive forces with water, so water beads up on the surface, as a consequence of its cohesion and surface tension. This minimizes the contact between water and metal, thus minimizing rust.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s04_p01">A solid is like a liquid in that particles are in contact with each other. Solids are unlike liquids in that the intermolecular forces are strong enough to hold the particles in place. At low enough temperatures, all substances are solids (helium is the lone exception), but the temperature at which the solid state becomes the stable phase varies widely among substances, from 20 K (−253°C) for hydrogen to over 3,900 K (3,600°C) for carbon.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s04_p02">The solid phase has several characteristics. First, solids maintain their shape. They do not fill their entire containers like gases do, and they do not adopt the shape of their containers like liquids do. They cannot be easily compressed like gases can, and they have relatively high densities.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s04_p03">Solids may also demonstrate a variety of properties. For example, many metals can be beaten into thin sheets or drawn into wires, while compounds such as NaCl will shatter if they are struck. Some metals, such as sodium and potassium, are rather soft, while others, such as diamond, are very hard and can easily scratch other substances. Appearances differ as well: most metals are shiny and silvery, but sulfur (a nonmetal) is yellow, and ionic compounds can take on a rainbow of colors. Solid metals conduct electricity and heat, while ionic solids do not. Many solids are opaque, but some are transparent. Some dissolve in water, but some do not. <a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s04_f01">Figure 10.13 "Properties of Solids"</a> shows two solids that exemplify the similar and dissimilar properties of solids.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s04_p04">Solids can have a wide variety of physical properties because there are different types of solids. Here we will review the different types of solids and the bonding that gives them their properties.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s04_p05">First, we must distinguish between two general types of solids. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">amorphous solid</a><span class="glossdef">A solid with no long-term structure or repetition.</span></span> is a solid with no long-term structure or repetition. Examples include glass and many plastics, both of which are composed of long chains of molecules with no order from one molecule to the next. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crystalline solid</a><span class="glossdef">A solid with a regular, repeating three-dimensional structure.</span></span> is a solid that has a regular, repeating three-dimensional structure. A crystal of NaCl (see <a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s04_f01">Figure 10.13 "Properties of Solids"</a>) is one example: at the atomic level, NaCl is composed of a regular three-dimensional array of Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions and Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup> ions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s04_p06">There is only one type of amorphous solid. However, there are several different types of crystalline solids, depending on the identity of the units that compose the crystal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s04_p07">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ionic solid</a><span class="glossdef">A crystalline solid composed of ions.</span></span> is a crystalline solid composed of ions (even if the ions are polyatomic). NaCl is an example of an ionic solid (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s04_f02">Figure 10.14 "An Ionic Solid"</a>). The Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions and Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup> ions alternate in three dimensions, repeating a pattern that goes on throughout the sample. The ions are held together by the attraction of opposite charges—a very strong force. Hence most ionic solids have relatively high melting points; for example, the melting point of NaCl is 801°C. Ionic solids are typically very brittle. To break them, the very strong ionic attractions need to be broken; a displacement of only about 1 × 10<sup class="superscript">−10</sup> m will move ions next to ions of the same charge, which results in repulsion. Ionic solids do not conduct electricity in their solid state; however, in the liquid state and when dissolved in some solvent, they do conduct electricity. This fact originally promoted the idea that some substances exist as ionic particles.</p>

Many molecular substances, especially when carefully solidified from the liquid state, form solids where the molecules line up with a regular fashion similar to an ionic crystal, but they are composed of molecules instead of ions. Because the intermolecular forces between molecules are typically less strong than in ionic solids, molecular solids typically melt at lower temperatures and are softer than ionic solids. Ice is an example of a molecular solid. In the solid state, the molecules line up in a regular pattern (<a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s04_f03">Figure 10.15 "Molecular Solids"</a>). Some very large molecules, such as biological molecules, will form crystals only if they are very carefully solidified from the liquid state or, more usually, from a dissolved state; otherwise, they will form amorphous solids.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ball-ch10_s04_p09">Some solids are composed of atoms of one or more elements that are covalently bonded together in a seemingly never-ending fashion. Such solids are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">covalent network solids</a><span class="glossdef">A crystalline solid composed of atoms of one or more elements that are covalently bonded together in a seemingly never-ending fashion.</span></span>. Each piece of the substance is essentially one huge molecule, as the covalent bonding in the crystal extends throughout the entire crystal. The two most commonly known covalent network solids are carbon in its diamond form and silicon dioxide (SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>). <a class="xref" href="#ball-ch10_s04_f04">Figure 10.16 "Covalent Network Solids"</a> shows the bonding in a covalent network solid. Generally, covalent network solids are poor conductors of electricity, although their ability to conduct heat is variable: diamond is one of the most thermally conductive substances known, while SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is about 100 times less thermally conductive. Most covalent network solids are very hard, as exemplified by diamond, which is the hardest known substance. Covalent network solids have high melting points by virtue of their network of covalent bonds, all of which would have to be broken for them to transform into a liquid. Indeed, covalent network solids are among the highest-melting substances known: the melting point of diamond is over 3,500°C, while the melting point of SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is around 1,650°C. These characteristics are explained by the network of covalent bonds throughout the sample.</p>

A metallic solid can also be hammered into sheets and pulled into wires. A metallic solid exhibits metallic bonding, a type of intermolecular interaction caused by the sharing of the <em class="emphasis">s</em> valence electrons by all atoms in the sample. It is the sharing of these valence electrons that explains the ability of metals to conduct electricity and heat well. It is also relatively easy for metals to lose these valence electrons, which explains why metallic elements usually form cations when they make compounds.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Food and Drink App: The Rocks We Eat</h3>
        <p class="para" id="ball-ch10_s04_p13">The foods and beverages we eat and drink all have different phases: solid, liquid, and gas. (How do we ingest gases? Carbonated beverages have gas, which sometimes cause a person to belch.) However, among the solids we eat, three in particular are, or are produced from, rocks. Yes, rocks!</p>
        <p class="para" id="ball-ch10_s04_p14">The first one is NaCl, or common salt. Salt is the only solid that we ingest that is actually mined as a rock (hence the term <em class="emphasis">rock salt</em>; it really is a rock). Salt provides both Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions and Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup> ions, both of which are necessary for good health. Salt preserves food, a function that was much more important before the days of modern food preparation and storage. The fact that saltiness is one of the major tastes the tongue can detect suggests a strong evolutionary link between ingesting salt and survival. There is some concern today that there is too much salt in the diet; it is estimated that the average person consumes at least three times as much salt daily than is necessary for proper bodily function.</p>
        <p class="para" id="ball-ch10_s04_p15">The other two rocks we eat are related: sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>) and sodium carbonate (Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>). However, we do not mine these substances directly from the ground; we mine trona, whose chemical formula is Na<sub class="subscript">3</sub>H(CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>)<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. This substance is dissolved in water and treated with CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> gas to make either Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> or NaHCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>. Another process, called the Solvay process, is also used to make Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>. In the Solvay process, NH<sub class="subscript">3</sub> and CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> are added to solutions of NaCl to make NaHCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> and NH<sub class="subscript">4</sub>Cl; the NaHCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> precipitates and is heated to produce Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>. Either way, we get these two products from the ground (i.e., rocks).</p>
        <p class="para" id="ball-ch10_s04_p16">NaHCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> is also known as baking soda, which is used in many baked goods. Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> is used in foods to regulate the acid balance. It is also used in laundry (where it is called washing soda) to interact with other ions in water that tend to reduce detergent efficiency.</p>
